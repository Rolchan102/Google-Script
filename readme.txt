Script1 - This function first fetches the HTML content of the basketball results website using the UrlFetchApp service. Then, it parses the HTML using the XmlService class, and extracts the drop

Script2 - This script uses the Cheerio library to parse the HTML and extract the data. The getBasketballResults function loops through each Categoria/Fase/Grupo combination, sets the dropdown values on the page, submits the form to get the results, and then extracts the data from the results table. The results are stored in an array of objects with the specified properties. Finally, the script logs the results to the console. Note that the script uses the UrlFetchApp service to fetch the HTML of the page, and it uses a 1 second delay (Utilities.sleep(1000)) after submitting the form to give the page time to load. You may need to adjust the delay time depending on the speed of your internet connection. To run the script, simply copy and paste it into a Google Apps.
